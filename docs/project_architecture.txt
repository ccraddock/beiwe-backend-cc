Admin/Access control:
	2 levels of users: researcher admins, and super admins.
	super-admins
		can create new researchers,
		reset researchers' passwords
		edit which studies researchers are attached to
		delete researchers
		create studies.
	admins should only have survey modification rights to on surveys in studies they are assigned to.

Randomized questions: surveys should be able to randomize their order
    surveys should be able to display a subset ("ask only 10 questions")
    -surveys should (optionally) be able to present questions totally at random
    -surveys should (optionally) be able to present a subset that guarantees all questions are asked

Surveys:
    able to have separate surveys for each study
    don't need a survey to be shared among multiple studies
    surveys must be able to be scheduled:
        once a week
        once a day
        multiple times per day

Customizable Times:
	-an option that can be editted on the edit survey page (not just survey creation)
	-error-checking (this isn't mentioned in the change order)
		for example, BLUETOOTH_ON_DURATION must be no longer than BLUETOOTH_PERIOD minus BLUETOOTH_START_TIME_IN_PERIOD.
 	-This is likely to be modified by the email thread about timers and data streams.

Customizable wording, customizable from the admin panel at the time of study creation:
	-Text on the "Call Clinician" buttons throughout the app.
	-Main body text on Voice Recording screen
	-About page text
	-Text in the Toast that pops up after a user submits a completed survey
	-Text in the Toast that pops up after a user submits a completed voice recording
	(We should probably limit text inputs to ASCII-only, not Unicode characters. The survey editor interface currently (June 29, 2015) has a check for Unicode characters in 
survey_designer.py/update_survey().)
